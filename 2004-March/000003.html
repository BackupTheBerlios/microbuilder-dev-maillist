<PRE>hello dev peeps

At 14:04 02.03.2004, you wrote:
&gt;<i>We checked the installer u sent us (it's REALLY gorgeous - can u say that for
</I>&gt;<i>an installer ?).
</I>&gt;<i>And used a lot postnuke to see how it feels regarding to the current site (we
</I>&gt;<i>use it ALOT ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Using postnuke as a basis for the microbuilder will greatly help, but we're
</I>&gt;<i>afraid that the micromusic site will have a &quot;postnuke feeling&quot;.
</I>
you're right, this can be a problem since postnuke typically uses this
left block, middle block, right block layout. until now i thought this isnt
a big problem since it is actually appropriate for the microbuilder/micromusic
layout, it is like LEGO blocks fitting together ;)
but of course we can also make it better there too.

the biggest problems are postnuke like sites which are vertically very
long already (scrolling) on the home page. i like it very compact, more 
like a block,
which opens up vertically as soon as you look at content.

&gt;<i>Actually, we
</I>&gt;<i>think that every microbuilder module should be recoded from scratch. This
</I>&gt;<i>will for sure give modules a functionnal and graphical consistency (a common
</I>&gt;<i>identity). Besides that, designing our own modules would permit _much easier_
</I>&gt;<i>maintenance and evolutions.
</I>
i also think that we should look at each module and re-code it if needed.


&gt;<i>A downgraded postnuke (+additionnal specifically implemented classes) will
</I>&gt;<i>be fully documented, with a stable API in order to permit easy module
</I>&gt;<i>development (we could also setup a special berlios project dedicated to
</I>&gt;<i>microbuilder modules - as dotproject does, see <A HREF="http://dotmods.sf.net">http://dotmods.sf.net</A>)
</I>
it would be nice if we dont need to change the postnukeAPI cos then we can
use postnuke modules and adapt them easily, and also refere to the API
documentation from postnuke.

&gt;<i>The software will have a the ability to provide external services for each
</I>&gt;<i>module (XML feeds, RPC, ...)
</I>
isnt this already included in postnuke in some way?
in the blocks admin section there is something like
&quot;Refresh time for block (only used for blocks that pull information from 
outside sources)&quot;

what is this for exactly?


&gt;<i>And we've seen that different things can be done to blast the performance
</I>&gt;<i>problems :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>After looking at the stats u sent us, we thought that many of the site's
</I>&gt;<i>sections could be pregenerated in HTML. For instance, as the MicroWarez is
</I>&gt;<i>only updated 5/6 times a month, html generetaion should only happen at update
</I>&gt;<i>time. This will permit to avoid using the php interpreter uselessly.
</I>
at the moment i use the pnRender module for the microeventz and microshop,
and it is possible to cache the pages as HTML. isnt this a method we could use?

&gt;<i>Pregeneration will be implemented as a flag that can be toggled by admins for
</I>&gt;<i>each module.
</I>
ok, sounds cool if possible :)


&gt;<i>If you have sufficient rights on micromusic.net web server it would also be
</I>&gt;<i>possible to optimize site's RAM consumption by setting up a lightweight
</I>&gt;<i>apache proxy (approx. 400k) to serve static pages (that's why html
</I>&gt;<i>pregeneration would be nice) .
</I>
i have root access to the micromusic.net server cos it is ours now.
but i dont know if we should work on the current micromusic.net site
since it is running ok atm. but for the recoded microbuilder/micromusic.net
soft we should really think about that properly.

&gt;<i>It would only raise an heavy php-capable apache process (several Mos) to 
</I>&gt;<i>serve
</I>&gt;<i>php pages (but maybe you've done that already?).
</I>
no, i havent. i'm not very experience with that.


&gt;<i>Bill (our local javascript wizard)  also raised the idea of a completely
</I>&gt;<i>alternative rendering method (the site's look wouldn't change) using
</I>&gt;<i>javascript (demo soon :).  Among other features, this would permit on demand
</I>&gt;<i>preloading of site's interface ( =&gt; no more page refreshing :). This might
</I>&gt;<i>not sound clear, but a demo will come soon in your hands !
</I>
oh ok, looking forward to seeing a demo then :)

&gt;<i>We don't know how advanced microbuilder has to be for the mid-april
</I>&gt;<i>prerelease.  So here's some info :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Until mid-April we can provide :
</I>&gt;<i>  - downgraded (yet fully working ;) postnuke (we only keep the backend)
</I>&gt;<i>  - stable API (so that module development can start)
</I>&gt;<i>  - html generation engine (something that will be called pnXHTML - xhtml
</I>&gt;<i>lowers pages' weight, is easily accessible by javascript, and so on...)
</I>&gt;<i>  - javascript rendering engine prototype
</I>&gt;<i>  - API docs for the above
</I>&gt;<i>  - a minimal example site with minimal example module
</I>&gt;<i>  - installer (you implemented it already ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Do you like these ideas?
</I>
thats great and exactly what we need. about the mid april release:
i dont think it is a shame if we present a piece of soft which doesnt yet
include all the technical aspects mentioned above. lets see it as a kick-off
event where we present the software and installer and functionality
to the public and explain what the future plans are and how people can 
participate.

we dont need a completely clean product until then, this wouldnt be possible
anyway i'm afraid.

&gt;<i>Your development plans for April are probably already established and our
</I>&gt;<i>proposal probably (yet it may ;) doesn't fit.
</I>
at the moment i adapt all the modules i think should be implemented until 
mid april:

microshop, microeventz, up/downloads, microliner, micronews, microFAQ, 
microlinks.

basically these are &quot;comsmetic&quot; changes i do, layout and navigation etc.

you can check the latest update here:

<A HREF="http://microbuilder.com/mbnuke/">http://microbuilder.com/mbnuke/</A>

microeventz and microshop are almost finished.

&gt;<i>April is coming soon, and it's sure we can't provide more that what mentioned
</I>&gt;<i>above. So, while you work at that prerelease,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>we can work on that proposal (if u like it :) and set up a nice, shiny and
</I>&gt;<i>documented API that you&amp;us can work on as of April
</I>
wow, it is really great that you can help me out there and i'm excited 
about your
input and ideas. thats exactly what we need to create a successful and shiny
CMS system in the future. :)

&gt;<i>Reading Microbuilder's project concept u sent us was great and we think that
</I>&gt;<i>the box deserves to have a CMS software as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>original as the book :) Motivation here is great ;)
</I>
yeah, i think it should be mainly very original and, second, technically simple
and stable and fast.

fast - fun - colorful ;)


&gt;<i>luuuuuukin' furward,
</I>
talk to you soon
