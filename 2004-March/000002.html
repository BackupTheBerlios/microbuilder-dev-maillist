<PRE>Ha&#239;!

We checked the installer u sent us (it's REALLY gorgeous - can u say that for 
an installer ?).
And used a lot postnuke to see how it feels regarding to the current site (we 
use it ALOT ;)

 Using postnuke as a basis for the microbuilder will greatly help, but we're 
afraid that the micromusic site will have a &quot;postnuke feeling&quot;. Actually, we 
think that every microbuilder module should be recoded from scratch. This 
will for sure give modules a functionnal and graphical consistency (a common 
identity). Besides that, designing our own modules would permit _much easier_ 
maintenance and evolutions.

A downgraded postnuke (+additionnal specifically implemented classes) will 
be fully documented, with a stable API in order to permit easy module 
development (we could also setup a special berlios project dedicated to 
microbuilder modules - as dotproject does, see <A HREF="http://dotmods.sf.net">http://dotmods.sf.net</A>)

The software will have a the ability to provide external services for each 
module (XML feeds, RPC, ...)

And we've seen that different things can be done to blast the performance 
problems :

After looking at the stats u sent us, we thought that many of the site's 
sections could be pregenerated in HTML. For instance, as the MicroWarez is 
only updated 5/6 times a month, html generetaion should only happen at update 
time. This will permit to avoid using the php interpreter uselessly. 
Pregeneration will be implemented as a flag that can be toggled by admins for 
each module.

If you have sufficient rights on micromusic.net web server it would also be 
possible to optimize site's RAM consumption by setting up a lightweight 
apache proxy (approx. 400k) to serve static pages (that's why html 
pregeneration would be nice) . 

It would only raise an heavy php-capable apache process (several Mos) to serve 
php pages (but maybe you've done that already?).

Bill (our local javascript wizard)  also raised the idea of a completely  
alternative rendering method (the site's look wouldn't change) using  
javascript (demo soon :).  Among other features, this would permit on demand  
preloading of site's interface ( =&gt; no more page refreshing :). This might  
not sound clear, but a demo will come soon in your hands !

We don't know how advanced microbuilder has to be for the mid-april 
prerelease.  So here's some info :

Until mid-April we can provide :
 - downgraded (yet fully working ;) postnuke (we only keep the backend)
 - stable API (so that module development can start)
 - html generation engine (something that will be called pnXHTML - xhtml 
lowers pages' weight, is easily accessible by javascript, and so on...)
 - javascript rendering engine prototype
 - API docs for the above
 - a minimal example site with minimal example module
 - installer (you implemented it already ;)

Do you like these ideas? 

Your development plans for April are probably already established and our 
proposal probably (yet it may ;) doesn't fit.
April is coming soon, and it's sure we can't provide more that what mentioned 
above. So, while you work at that prerelease, 

we can work on that proposal (if u like it :) and set up a nice, shiny and 
documented API that you&amp;us can work on as of April 

;)

Reading Microbuilder's project concept u sent us was great and we think that 
the box deserves to have a CMS software as 

original as the book :) Motivation here is great ;)

luuuuuukin' furward,

Bertier, Bill &amp; Divag
