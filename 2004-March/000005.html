Maybe Bill can explain a bit the javascript rendering (if he is not to busy 
coding the prototype :)

hey there

thanks for your email and sorry for not geting in touch with
you for almost 1 week. i was busy with other things involved
with the microbuilder release date, which will be 21st of april.
fixed.

At 02:08 10.03.2004, you wrote:
&gt;<i>a whole week to write a simple email ! hum :S things have been done anyway
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>
wow

&gt;<i>we discussed extensively, made things clear between us (that's important !).
</I>&gt;<i>Bill will provide a working prototype of the rendering engine tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i>Postnuke downgrading will finish by the end of the week :) (with installer).
</I>&gt;<i>Answers to your questions and reactions to your comments follow.
</I>&gt;<i>We seem to agree on everything (yeah!;) but the postnuke compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's discuss it :) !
</I>
yes!!

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it would be nice if we dont need to change the postnukeAPI cos then we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can use postnuke modules and adapt them easily, and also refere to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; API documentation from postnuke.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>we do not really agree with this ... as stated in the microbuilder concept
</I>&gt;<i>doc, the microbuilder has to be _simple_. each micromodule micromodule has
</I>&gt;<i> to be specific, and simple too. Postnuke modules (because that is their
</I>&gt;<i> purpose) are bloated with functionnality and are designed to be _very_
</I>&gt;<i> generic and adaptative. And we feel that Microbuilder does'nt need to be as
</I>&gt;<i> generic as postnuke, does it ?
</I>
ok, i think your arguments are right, and in fact at the very beginning i
though
the microbuilder needs a completely new &quot;engine&quot; from scratch. then
i realized that postnuke has included the most things we need. so
actually you convinced me to &quot;downsize&quot; the postnuke cms and extend it
with microbuilder/micromusic functionality.

maybe i was a bit scared to start working on this but with your help,
 know-how and experience i can imagine that this is the right way to do it.

&gt;<i>We really think that breakin compatibility with postnuke is important :
</I>&gt;<i>  - code maintenance is easier when you have developed the modules (postnuke
</I>&gt;<i>documentation is really awful)
</I>&gt;<i>  - micromusic site needs to have a strong personnality. Using third party
</I>&gt;<i>modules will decrease this personnality.
</I>
you're right, i agree.

&gt;<i>  - we don't need the microbuilder to evolve as fast / the same way as
</I>&gt;<i>postnuke. the microbuilder does'nt aim to be a worldwide spread generic cms
</I>&gt;<i>management system.
</I>
i agree. it would be perfect if the microbuilder would have a very
special &quot;character&quot; and &quot;style&quot; as described in the microbuilder docs.

&gt;<i>  postnuke base will be very useful but we really shouldn't use the top
</I>&gt;<i> layer of the application (modules, rendering, ...). It is not well
</I>&gt;<i> documented and doens't feet our needs.
</I>
ok, i'm convinced!!

&gt;<i>  Once the Microbuilder finished, we'll have fully functionnal cms system
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i>a fully original rendering system, modules highly specialized in music
</I>&gt;<i>community management capable of interacting with the site's interface. The
</I>&gt;<i>microbuilder (nicely documented) API will permit microcoders to develop
</I>&gt;<i>supplementary modules easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; The software will have a the ability to provide external services for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; each module (XML feeds, RPC, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; isnt this already included in postnuke in some way?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in the blocks admin section there is something like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;Refresh time for block (only used for blocks that pull information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; from outside sources)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>XML feed generation is disponible in postnuke for news item, but its
</I>&gt;<i>implementation is very limited and it would be much better to recode this.
</I>&gt;<i>(The blocks your speaking of do not provide external service but pull their
</I>&gt;<i>information from such services)
</I>
ok, it would be perfekt if websites could &quot;link together&quot; and exchange
content easily. also i could imagine that we could use this for mirroring,
one server in europe, one in asia/australia and one in the USA...

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; at the moment i use the pnRender module for the microeventz and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; microshop, and it is possible to cache the pages as HTML. isnt this a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; method we could use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>pnRender is very nice but it still uses table markup, which is not good and
</I>&gt;<i>wouldn't work with javascript rendering. Besides that, pnRender is much more
</I>&gt;<i>heavy / complex than what is really needed to set up a fantastic
</I>&gt;<i>microbuilder.
</I>
just cos i'm curious: the pnXHTML render engine your talking about will
basically work with &quot;layers&quot; which are placed, hidden or displayed by
javascript,
right? or wrong?
do you still want to use frames then or realize it on &quot;one page&quot; with
 layers?? maybe i cant explain my questions very well but i hope u
 understand...

yo, talk again soon. i'm getting excited and am glad you're all involved!

best
carl
