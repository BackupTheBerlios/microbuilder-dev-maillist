<PRE>Hi :)

a whole week to write a simple email ! hum :S things have been done anyway :)
we discussed extensively, made things clear between us (that's important !). 
Bill will provide a working prototype of the rendering engine tomorrow. 
Postnuke downgrading will finish by the end of the week :) (with installer). 
Answers to your questions and reactions to your comments follow.
We seem to agree on everything (yeah!;) but the postnuke compatibility. Let's 
discuss it :) !


&gt;&gt;<i> it would be nice if we dont need to change the postnukeAPI cos then we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can use postnuke modules and adapt them easily, and also refere to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> API documentation from postnuke.
</I>we do not really agree with this ... as stated in the microbuilder concept 
doc, the microbuilder has to be _simple_. each micromodule micromodule has to 
be specific, and simple too. Postnuke modules (because that is their purpose) 
are bloated with functionnality and are designed to be _very_ generic and 
adaptative. And we feel that Microbuilder does'nt need to be as generic as 
postnuke, does it ?
We really think that breakin compatibility with postnuke is important :
 - code maintenance is easier when you have developed the modules (postnuke 
documentation is really awful)
 - micromusic site needs to have a strong personnality. Using third party 
modules will decrease this personnality.
 - we don't need the microbuilder to evolve as fast / the same way as 
postnuke. the microbuilder does'nt aim to be a worldwide spread generic cms 
management system.
 postnuke base will be very useful but we really shouldn't use the top layer 
of the application (modules, rendering, ...). It is not well documented and 
doens't feet our needs.
 Once the Microbuilder finished, we'll have fully functionnal cms system with 
a fully original rendering system, modules highly specialized in music 
community management capable of interacting with the site's interface. The 
microbuilder (nicely documented) API will permit microcoders to develop 
supplementary modules easily.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The software will have a the ability to provide external services for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each module (XML feeds, RPC, ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isnt this already included in postnuke in some way?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the blocks admin section there is something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Refresh time for block (only used for blocks that pull information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from outside sources)&quot;
</I>XML feed generation is disponible in postnuke for news item, but its 
implementation is very limited and it would be much better to recode this.
(The blocks your speaking of do not provide external service but pull their 
information from such services)


&gt;&gt;<i> at the moment i use the pnRender module for the microeventz and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> microshop, and it is possible to cache the pages as HTML. isnt this a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> method we could use?
</I>pnRender is very nice but it still uses table markup, which is not good and 
wouldn't work with javascript rendering. Besides that, pnRender is much more 
heavy / complex than what is really needed to set up a fantastic 
microbuilder. 



greeetz and quicker answers ;)

Divag, Bill &amp; Bertier
