Ha?!

We checked the installer u sent us (it's REALLY gorgeous - can u say that for 
an installer ?).
And used a lot postnuke to see how it feels regarding to the current site (we 
use it ALOT ;)

 Using postnuke as a basis for the microbuilder will greatly help, but we're 
afraid that the micromusic site will have a "postnuke feeling". Actually, we 
think that every microbuilder module should be recoded from scratch. This 
will for sure give modules a functionnal and graphical consistency (a common 
identity). Besides that, designing our own modules would permit _much easier_ 
maintenance and evolutions.

A downgraded postnuke (+additionnal specifically implemented classes) will 
be fully documented, with a stable API in order to permit easy module 
development (we could also setup a special berlios project dedicated to 
microbuilder modules - as dotproject does, see http://dotmods.sf.net)

The software will have a the ability to provide external services for each 
module (XML feeds, RPC, ...)

And we've seen that different things can be done to blast the performance 
problems :

After looking at the stats u sent us, we thought that many of the site's 
sections could be pregenerated in HTML. For instance, as the MicroWarez is 
only updated 5/6 times a month, html generetaion should only happen at update 
time. This will permit to avoid using the php interpreter uselessly. 
Pregeneration will be implemented as a flag that can be toggled by admins for 
each module.

If you have sufficient rights on micromusic.net web server it would also be 
possible to optimize site's RAM consumption by setting up a lightweight 
apache proxy (approx. 400k) to serve static pages (that's why html 
pregeneration would be nice) . 

It would only raise an heavy php-capable apache process (several Mos) to serve 
php pages (but maybe you've done that already?).

Bill (our local javascript wizard)  also raised the idea of a completely  
alternative rendering method (the site's look wouldn't change) using  
javascript (demo soon :).  Among other features, this would permit on demand  
preloading of site's interface ( => no more page refreshing :). This might  
not sound clear, but a demo will come soon in your hands !

We don't know how advanced microbuilder has to be for the mid-april 
prerelease.  So here's some info :

Until mid-April we can provide :
 - downgraded (yet fully working ;) postnuke (we only keep the backend)
 - stable API (so that module development can start)
 - html generation engine (something that will be called pnXHTML - xhtml 
lowers pages' weight, is easily accessible by javascript, and so on...)
 - javascript rendering engine prototype
 - API docs for the above
 - a minimal example site with minimal example module
 - installer (you implemented it already ;)

Do you like these ideas? 

Your development plans for April are probably already established and our 
proposal probably (yet it may ;) doesn't fit.
April is coming soon, and it's sure we can't provide more that what mentioned 
above. So, while you work at that prerelease, 

we can work on that proposal (if u like it :) and set up a nice, shiny and 
documented API that you&us can work on as of April 

;)

Reading Microbuilder's project concept u sent us was great and we think that 
the box deserves to have a CMS software as 

original as the book :) Motivation here is great ;)

you're right, this can be a problem since postnuke typically uses this
left block, middle block, right block layout. until now i thought this isnt
a big problem since it is actually appropriate for the microbuilder/micromusic
layout, it is like LEGO blocks fitting together ;)
but of course we can also make it better there too.

the biggest problems are postnuke like sites which are vertically very
long already (scrolling) on the home page. i like it very compact, more 
like a block,
which opens up vertically as soon as you look at content.

i also think that we should look at each module and re-code it if needed.

it would be nice if we dont need to change the postnukeAPI cos then we can
use postnuke modules and adapt them easily, and also refere to the API
documentation from postnuke.

>The software will have a the ability to provide external services for each
>module (XML feeds, RPC, ...)

isnt this already included in postnuke in some way?
in the blocks admin section there is something like
"Refresh time for block (only used for blocks that pull information from 
outside sources)"

what is this for exactly?

at the moment i use the pnRender module for the microeventz and microshop,
and it is possible to cache the pages as HTML. isnt this a method we could use?

ok, sounds cool if possible :)

i have root access to the micromusic.net server cos it is ours now.
but i dont know if we should work on the current micromusic.net site
since it is running ok atm. but for the recoded microbuilder/micromusic.net
soft we should really think about that properly.

no, i havent. i'm not very experience with that.

thats great and exactly what we need. about the mid april release:
i dont think it is a shame if we present a piece of soft which doesnt yet
include all the technical aspects mentioned above. lets see it as a kick-off
event where we present the software and installer and functionality
to the public and explain what the future plans are and how people can 
participate.

we dont need a completely clean product until then, this wouldnt be possible
anyway i'm afraid.

>Your development plans for April are probably already established and our
>proposal probably (yet it may ;) doesn't fit.

at the moment i adapt all the modules i think should be implemented until 
mid april:

microshop, microeventz, up/downloads, microliner, micronews, microFAQ, 
microlinks.

basically these are "comsmetic" changes i do, layout and navigation etc.

you can check the latest update here:

http://microbuilder.com/mbnuke/

microeventz and microshop are almost finished.

wow, it is really great that you can help me out there and i'm excited 
about your
input and ideas. thats exactly what we need to create a successful and shiny
CMS system in the future. :)

yeah, i think it should be mainly very original and, second, technically simple
and stable and fast.

fast - fun - colorful ;)

Hi :)

a whole week to write a simple email ! hum :S things have been done anyway :)
we discussed extensively, made things clear between us (that's important !). 
Bill will provide a working prototype of the rendering engine tomorrow. 
Postnuke downgrading will finish by the end of the week :) (with installer). 
Answers to your questions and reactions to your comments follow.
We seem to agree on everything (yeah!;) but the postnuke compatibility. Let's 
discuss it :) !


>> it would be nice if we dont need to change the postnukeAPI cos then we
>> can use postnuke modules and adapt them easily, and also refere to the
>> API documentation from postnuke.
we do not really agree with this ... as stated in the microbuilder concept 
doc, the microbuilder has to be _simple_. each micromodule micromodule has to 
be specific, and simple too. Postnuke modules (because that is their purpose) 
are bloated with functionnality and are designed to be _very_ generic and 
adaptative. And we feel that Microbuilder does'nt need to be as generic as 
postnuke, does it ?
We really think that breakin compatibility with postnuke is important :
 - code maintenance is easier when you have developed the modules (postnuke 
documentation is really awful)
 - micromusic site needs to have a strong personnality. Using third party 
modules will decrease this personnality.
 - we don't need the microbuilder to evolve as fast / the same way as 
postnuke. the microbuilder does'nt aim to be a worldwide spread generic cms 
management system.
 postnuke base will be very useful but we really shouldn't use the top layer 
of the application (modules, rendering, ...). It is not well documented and 
doens't feet our needs.
 Once the Microbuilder finished, we'll have fully functionnal cms system with 
a fully original rendering system, modules highly specialized in music 
community management capable of interacting with the site's interface. The 
microbuilder (nicely documented) API will permit microcoders to develop 
supplementary modules easily.

>>> The software will have a the ability to provide external services for

>> isnt this already included in postnuke in some way?

XML feed generation is disponible in postnuke for news item, but its 
implementation is very limited and it would be much better to recode this.
(The blocks your speaking of do not provide external service but pull their 
information from such services)


>> at the moment i use the pnRender module for the microeventz and

pnRender is very nice but it still uses table markup, which is not good and 
wouldn't work with javascript rendering. Besides that, pnRender is much more 
heavy / complex than what is really needed to set up a fantastic 
microbuilder. 



greeetz and quicker answers ;)

thanks for your email and sorry for not geting in touch with

with the microbuilder release date, which will be 21st of april.
fixed.

ok, i think your arguments are right, and in fact at the very beginning i
though
the microbuilder needs a completely new "engine" from scratch. then
i realized that postnuke has included the most things we need. so
actually you convinced me to "downsize" the postnuke cms and extend it
with microbuilder/micromusic functionality.

maybe i was a bit scared to start working on this but with your help,
 know-how and experience i can imagine that this is the right way to do it.

you're right, i agree.

i agree. it would be perfect if the microbuilder would have a very
special "character" and "style" as described in the microbuilder docs.

ok, it would be perfekt if websites could "link together" and exchange
content easily. also i could imagine that we could use this for mirroring,
one server in europe, one in asia/australia and one in the USA...

just cos i'm curious: the pnXHTML render engine your talking about will
basically work with "layers" which are placed, hidden or displayed by
javascript,
right? or wrong?
do you still want to use frames then or realize it on "one page" with
 layers?? maybe i cant explain my questions very well but i hope u
 understand...

yo, talk again soon. i'm getting excited and am glad you're all involved!

hey :)

Ripping files off postnuke at the moment and wandering :

I'm not sure that the multilanguages capabilities of the cms should be kept. 
Micromusic is in "euroenglish"... I think that the site's language (and 
appearance) should be the same for every user.  But that's my point of 
view :) what about yours ?

yes, for micromusic we dont need more than one language.

but for more general use of the microbuilder software it should be
possible to keep the ability of easy editing and adapting of text in
modules.

ok :)

 * how it works in postnuke :
   - Every line of text in postnuke is associated to a constant ( ie. <input 
type="submit" label="<?php echo _CONSTANTNAME ?>" /> ).
   - Files located in /language/<langcode>/ 
and /modules/<modulename>/<langcode>/ contain definition of constants for 
<langcode> corresponding language.
   - NS-Language module provides a gui for creating translations
   - Default <langcode> is 'eng'

 * here's what we'll do :
   - Completely remove NS-Language
   - Remove every <langcode>/ rep except for <langcode> == eng
   - Maintain multilingual capabilities for the installer (do you agree with 
that ?)

be fully validated before).

and now it's time to slim the API :)))

looking forward for feedback!

I think we can use webspace provided by berlios (at 
http://microbuilder.berlios.de) to set up a "Microbuilder developers' 
ressources" site ?

Do you like this idea ???

:) and soon

until mid april we'll have a stable, downgraded and tested version of Postnuke 
+ good documentation but no modules. We'll have then to plugin bill's 
renderer and code necessary modules.

i just kept the perm system, the data access layer and the module managment 
system.
At the moment it cannot be used, a successful installation will lead to an 
error page (that is normal). I continue downgrading / documenting every 
single file of postnuke, i'll let you know when it will get useable :))

I can set up a system that sends an email (ie. to 
microbuilder-cvs at lists.berlios.de)  on every cvs checkin - it can help 
intersted people in following what is done during downgrade.
I'll set it up if anyone is intersted in it :)
