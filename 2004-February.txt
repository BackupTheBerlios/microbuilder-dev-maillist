hi dev peepz

here my first installer package for download:

http://install.micromusic.org/downloads/microbuilder_0.5b.zip

it is still an unfinished version and does even include a real bad photo 
album module
which we should remove again.

to explain in short what my goals where and what i did with the original 
postnuke system:

goal:
i wanted to have a frame system running parallel to the "normal postnuke" 
page where i can
define themes individually for each frame and it should still be possible 
to run standard
postnuke modules without any modification.

what i did:

1. i copied all central documents (index.php, modules.php, header.php, 
user.php, admin.php etc.) and
renamed it with a mb_ prefix (ex. mb_microbuilder)

2. i copied the "modules.php file and renamed it for each frame:

   mb_chat = microtalk block (i used the buddies module and block for that 
and modified it)

   mb_blocks = side blocks (in the frame system only side block on the 
right side of the standard
   postnuke system are displayed. login block is never displayed there)

   mb_modules = the modules main content is displayed here

   mb_navigation = a modified navigation block is displayed here (block 
mb_navigation)

   mb_oneline = not yet functional, but should display microlinez content 
in the future

   mb_logo = not yet fully functional, but should display logo and server 
load in the future

then i changed the themes for the frames to only display either the 
specific blocks or
module content. also i added a <base target="mbmodules"> tag in the header of
the blocks frame html code to force unmodified blocks to show linked 
content in the mbmodules
frame and made the frames reload by javascript if needed.

the "buddies" (now mb_microtalk) and "Messages" module were primitively 
hacked by
myself to let  guests show up in the chat frame and give them a unique 
number. guest
are also allowed to send messages. a big and dirty hack, i have no idea if 
i coded
a hundred security holes there ;) ....

also a bit dirty hacking was the forwarding script i put into the header of 
the main scripts
(index.php, modules.php, user.php and admin.php) to ensure that clicking on 
links of
unmodified modules in the frame modus wouldnt change into singlepage modus 
again.
real dirty hack but i need it to test new modules and make common modules
compatible to my frame system.

changed modules:
at the moment only the "mb_microeventz" module is completely adapted with 
the new
functionality and layout i have in mind for the microbuilder/new 
micromusic.net system.
it also shows how i think subnavigation should be implement .

all the othermodules are still a mess, only header info are mostly 
displayed correctly at the
moment. remember that the modules should display the content correctly both in
single- and frames mode. only the style sheets are different and headers 
can be modified.

and dont pass this installer 0.5b around cos it is still very messy, it is 
just for developers
at the moment. but it would be nice to discuss how to realize such a system 
properly,
and find better and cleaner solutions for future versions of course :)

ok, check out the installer .zip and let me know if it works!!

bestz & talk to you soon
carl


ps: maybe you need to

#chmod 777 pnTemp/pnRender_cached

and

#chmod 777 pnTemp/pnRender_compiles

after installation to let pnRender access those directories. i havent 
implemented that yet in the
installer...
