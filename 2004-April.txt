hi dev people!!

how are you? how's it going with the coding?

i just wanted to let you know that we need all files and docs
of the 2.0 version until april 17 (sat), because then we
have to start burning the CDs.

for the book i'm not sure if we really need documentation
material, i think we can live without that in the book.

but on the CD all the files and docs are important.

let me know if that's possible & all tha bestz
carl

i'll make a nice releaz then. but what we will have until 17st april is 
postnuke downgraded version with no modules. It won't be usable for a regular 
user. It's just a base to start developing new modules.

i totally agree. tech doc is quite boring and the book shouldn't bore 
anyone ;)

greetZ!
